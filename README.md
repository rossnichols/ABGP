# ABGP
EPGP AddOn for &lt;Always Be Pulling>, Atiesh, World of Warcraft Classic

Features (all users):
* Displays GP values for items in their tooltips

Features (guild officers):
* Shift+clicking on items while in a raid will announce the item to /rw to begin distribution.
* If you're the Master Looter, when the loot window appears, the loot will be automatically announced to /rw. This only occurs if at least one item is BoP and has a GP value, but all BoP items at or above the ML threshold will be announced.
