3:15 PM] groggy: the next BIG think that would help is live updating of the epgp (even if its just for the person running loot to view)
[3:15 PM] groggy: thing*
[3:15 PM] Xanido: for that first release, it'd all be powered by hardcoded tables - not updated dynamically. i'd just release new versions with new data imported, after raids
[3:15 PM] groggy: and even if we still have to manually update spreadsheet or whatever
[3:15 PM] groggy: that would start to eliminate the second screen and let us test accuracy
[3:16 PM] groggy: so when we switch over we have ironed out any issues
[3:16 PM] groggy: but I think thats where I would lean on you to tell me what makes sense from build out pov
[3:17 PM] groggy: Im sure there are interdependencies I am not considering
[3:17 PM] groggy: if I made a caveman idea of what I think the phases look like, its :
[3:17 PM] groggy: 1. I can see costs and speed up loot
[3:18 PM] groggy: 2. bare minimum needed to work without going full sync etc
[3:18 PM] groggy: 3. this is the addon that should work and do loot for us even if we never added another feature - it works but may have rough edges etc
[3:18 PM] groggy: 4. this is the robust version of 3
